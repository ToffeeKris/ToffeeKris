# console.log('Hey there!');

Hey there I'm Kris, and I still need to learn to type and write. I'm currently trying to learn JavaScript to make games(like a visual novel similar to the layout of Slay the Princess). I also write stuff and have some hyperfixations too. I'm currently on [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/toffeekris.bsky.social) and Tumblr, and yep that's it.

Hyperfixations:
- Pokemon
- UTMV(UnderTale MultiVerse)
- Writing Yaoi
- Slay the Princess

<strong>Your main take aways:</strong>
- I'm Kris
- I'm a nerd
- I write stuff
- I want to learn to make a visual novel
